Inlcuding every .file\n# Moving Everything One Folder Up in Zsh (Including Hidden Files)\n\nTo move all files and directories (including hidden files that start with a dot) from the current directory to its parent directory, you can use one of these commands in zsh:\n\n## Option 1: Using mv with globbing\n```zsh\nmv *(D) ..\n```\nThe `(D)` glob qualifier makes the pattern match hidden (dot) files as well.\n\n## Option 2: Using a more explicit approach\n```zsh\nmv ./* ../.  # Move visible files/folders\nmv ./.[^.]* ../. 2>/dev/null  # Move hidden files/folders (suppressing errors)\n```\n\n## Option 3: Using find\n```zsh\nfind . -maxdepth 1 -not -name \".\" -exec mv {} .. \\;\n```\n\n## Important Notes:\n- These commands will fail if files with the same names already exist in the parent directory\n- If you want to override existing files, add the `-f` flag to the mv command\n- Be cautious with these commands, especially when using wildcards\n- Consider testing in a safe environment or backing up important data first\n\nWould you like me to explain any of these options in more detail?\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":29}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":8},"start":85,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":30}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":9},"start":1131,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":31}}}],"summary":"Moving files up one directory","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
