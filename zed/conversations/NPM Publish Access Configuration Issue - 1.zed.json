I can't seem to run npm publish --access=public\nBased on the package.json file you've provided, there's nothing inherently wrong with your npm settings for publishing. Your package is correctly configured with `\"publishConfig\": { \"access\": \"public\" }` which should allow you to publish it as a public scoped package.\n\nWhen you're trying to run `npm publish --access=public` and encountering issues, it could be due to several reasons:\n\n1. **Authentication issues**: Ensure you're logged in to npm with `npm login` and have the proper permissions to publish to the @byggforsk organization.\n\n2. **Registry configuration**: Make sure you're publishing to the correct registry. Check your .npmrc file or run `npm config get registry` to confirm.\n\n3. **Version conflicts**: If the same version of the package already exists on npm, you'll need to update the version number before publishing.\n\n4. **Error messages**: The specific error message when you run `npm publish` would be helpful to diagnose the exact problem.\n\n5. **Organization access**: Ensure your npm account has access to publish packages under the @byggforsk organization.\n\nIf you're still having trouble, I would recommend:\n- Running `npm publish --verbose` to get more detailed error information\n- Checking if you need to pay for npm organizations (if this is a private organization)\n- Verifying your npm user has the correct permissions\n\nWithout seeing the specific error message, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact issue.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1841}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":1795},"start":1352,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1842}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":1796},"start":2791,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1843}}}],"summary":"NPM Publish Access Configuration Issue","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":3,"end":1256},"icon":"File","label":"icons-fundament/package.json","metadata":{"path":"icons-fundament/package.json"}}]}
